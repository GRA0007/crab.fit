If you can, please open an issue about the bug or feature you want to work on before starting your PR, to prevent work duplication and give others a chance to improve your idea.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and ensure you have `node`, `yarn` and `rust` installed on your machine.
2. Run `yarn` in `frontend` folder to install dependencies, then `yarn dev` to start the dev server.
3. Run `cargo run` in the `api` folder to start the API.

### 🔌 Browser extension

The browser extension in `browser-extension` can be tested by first running the frontend, and changing the iframe url in the extension's `popup.html` to match the local Crab Fit. Then it can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome to test.

## Deploy

Deployments are managed with GitHub Workflows. The frontend is deployed using Vercel, and the API uses Fly.io.

More detailed instructions on setting up your own deployment are coming soon.

### 🔌 Browser extension

Compress everything inside the `browser-extension` folder and use that zip to deploy using Chrome web store and Mozilla Add-on store.
